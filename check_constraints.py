# Based on the error messages, the foreign key constraints are:
# - rating_table references book_table (not new_book_table)
# - feedback_table references book_table (not new_book_table)

solution = """
The issue is with the foreign key constraints in the database tables:
1. rating_table has a foreign key constraint referencing book_table.book_id
2. feedback_table has a foreign key constraint referencing book_table.book_id

But our application is using new_book_table, not book_table.

We need to either:
1. Update the table structures to reference new_book_table instead of book_table
2. Use book_table instead of new_book_table in our application

For now, let's check if book_table exists and has data.
