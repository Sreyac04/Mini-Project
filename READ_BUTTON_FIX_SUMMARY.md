# Read Now Button Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Read Now" button in book.html was not working properly. When users clicked the button, they were being redirected instead of being able to read the book.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the [read_book](file:///C:/Users/USER/Desktop/SREYA/Mini-Project/app.py#L215-L227) route in app.py. The route was trying to select a `content` column from the [new_book_table](file:///C:/Users/USER/Desktop/SREYA/Mini-Project/app.py#L76-L76), but this column doesn't exist in the table structure. This caused a database error, which resulted in users being redirected to the recommended books page instead of being able to read the book.

## Solution
1. **Fixed the database query**: Removed the `content` column from the SELECT statement in the [read_book](file:///C:/Users/USER/Desktop/SREYA/Mini-Project/app.py#L215-L227) route since it doesn't exist in [new_book_table](file:///C:/Users/USER/Desktop/SREYA/Mini-Project/app.py#L76-L76).

2. **Improved error handling**: Added better error messages to help diagnose issues in the future.

3. **Enhanced user feedback**: Added a loading message when the "Read Now" button is clicked to improve user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed app.py
- Modified the [read_book](file:///C:/Users/USER/Desktop/SREYA/Mini-Project/app.py#L215-L227) route to remove the non-existent `content` column from the database query
- Improved error messages to be more specific

### 2. Enhanced book.html
- Added a loading message when the "Read Now" button is clicked
- Kept the existing functionality intact

## Verification
- Tested the database connection - working properly
- Verified the table structure - confirmed `content` column doesn't exist
- Tested the fixed route - now returns status code 200 (success)
- Confirmed the "Read Now" button now works correctly

## Additional Improvements
1. Better error messages for easier debugging
2. User feedback when loading content
3. More robust error handling

The "Read Now" button should now work correctly for all users.
