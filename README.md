##AI-BASED PERSONALIZED BOOK RECOMMENDATION ENGINE

###Abstract

The AI-BASED PERSONALIZED BOOK RECOMMENDATION ENGINE  is a web based system design to develop an AI powered book recommendation engine that helps users to discover books according to their reading preference. The system leverages machine learning techniques such as content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to analyze user behavior and book metadata. The application is built using Python for backend processing, with libraries like Scikit-learn  while the front end is developed using Html/Css for a simple and interactive user interface. The core functionality includes user input for favorite books or ratings, real-time recommendation generation, and displaying similar books based on user preferences. AI plays a crucial role by applying algorithms that learn from user choices and suggest books with similar themes, genres, or patterns using similarity scores. In conclusion, this system offers a smart and efficient way to enhance the reading experience by providing personalized book suggestions through artificial intelligence.
