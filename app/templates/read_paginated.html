            <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, Two households, both alike in dignity. From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
            
            <p>The fearful passage of their death-marked love, And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
            
            <p>SCENE I. Verona. A public place. Enter Sampson and Gregory, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers. SAMPSON. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals. GREGORY. No, for then we should be colliers. SAMPSON. I mean, if we be in choler, we'll draw. GREGORY. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</p>

            <p>SAMPSON. I strike quickly, being moved. GREGORY. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. SAMPSON. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. GREGORY. To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</p>
            
            <p>SAMPSON. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. GREGORY. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall.</p>
            
            <p>SAMPSON. True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. GREGORY. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. SAMPSON. 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids; I will cut off their heads.</p>

Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</p>
            
            <p>GREGORY. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool; here comes two of the house of Montagues. SAMPSON. My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. GREGORY. How? Turn thy back and run? SAMPSON. Fear me not.</p>
            
            <p>GREGORY. No, marry; I fear thee! SAMPSON. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. GREGORY. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. SAMPSON. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is disgrace to them, if they bear it.</p>

            <p>GREGORY. [Aside to SAMPSON] No. SAMPSON. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir. ABRAHAM. Do you quarrel, sir? SAMPSON. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. ABRAHAM. But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.</p>

            <p>BENVOLIO. I do but keep the peace. Put thy sword up, Or manage it to part these men with me. TYBALT. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: Have at thee, coward!</p>

Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: I drew to part them: in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd, Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears, He swung about his head and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted either part.</p>
            
            <p>LADY MONTAGUE. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day? Right glad I am he was not at this fray. BENVOLIO. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the city's side, So early walking did I see your son: Towards him I made; but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood.</p>

Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shoots his sad eyes from custom of himself, And bakes the marvellous sweets of melancholy.</p>
            
            <p>These are the limits of my child's survey; You that be older than he, let him counsel. BENVOLIO. I'll know his grievance, or be much denied. MONTAGUE. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay, To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away. Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague.</p>

She will not stay the siege of loving terms, Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: O, she is rich in beauty, only poor, That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</p>
            
            <p>BENVOLIO. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? ROMEO. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty starv'd with her severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair: She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</p>

            <p>BENVOLIO. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her. ROMEO. O, teach me how I should forget to think. BENVOLIO. By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties.</p>
            
            <p>ROMEO. 'Tis the way To call hers exquisite, in question more: These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows Being black put us in mind they hide the fair; He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost: Show me a mistress that is passing fair, Where I may read which manner is most true, She hath as much dishonour'd my poor eye As those that have more cunning, I say none; Nor are mine ears with their sweet music dull'd.</p>

A torch for me: let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels, For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase; I'll be a candle-holder and look on. The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.</p>
            
            <p>BENVOLIO. Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word: If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire Of this--sit, stay, and play, and go to bed. ROMEO. Nay, that's not so. BENVOLIO. I mean, sir, in delay We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.</p>
            
            <p>Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our five wits. ROMEO. And we mean well in going to this mask; But 'tis no wit to go. BENVOLIO. Why, may one ask?</p>

            <p>BENVOLIO. O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; Her waggon-spokes made of long spiders' legs, The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, The traces of the smallest spider's web, The collars of the moonshine's watery beams, Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat, Not so big as a round little worm Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.</p>

            <p>And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight, O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep, Then dreams he of another benefice; Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again.</p>

            <p>ROMEO. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing. MERCUTIO. True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</p>

            <p>SCENE II. A street. Enter Capulet's Servant. SERVANT. Whither, as to the Capitol, with my hose upon my shoulders? Second Servant. Why, sir, your own clothes, or, in other words, yourself.</p>
            
            <p>SERVANT. Yourself! Why, sir, I am a very good piece of earth. Second Servant. That's a lie, sir; you are not so good a piece of earth as you would make yourself. SERVANT. How can you prove that?</p>

            <p>SERVANT. God gi' good den. I pray, sir, can you read? Enter Romeo and Benvolio. ROMEO. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. BENVOLIO. Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I pray, can you read anything you see?</p>
            
            <p>SERVANT. Ay, if I know the letters and the language. BENVOLIO. Ye say honestly: rest you merry! SERVANT. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads. 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; The lady widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; Mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; My fair niece Rosaline and her cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena.'</p>
            
            <p>A fair assembly. Whither should they come? ROMEO. Up. SERVANT. Whither? ROMEO. To supper; to our house. SERVANT. Whose house? ROMEO. My father's. SERVANT. Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.</p>
            
            <p>BENVOLIO. Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! BENVOLIO. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest, With all the admired beauties of Verona: Go thither; and, with unattainted eye, Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.</p>
            
            <p>ROMEO. When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; And these, who often drown'd them in my tears, Seeing sun and not sun, shall divinely tell Him to whom all things that are sick doth sell.</p>
            
            <p>BENVOLIO. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt</p>
